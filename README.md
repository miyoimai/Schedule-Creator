# Schedule-Creator
The Drexel CCI Class Schedule web application combines HTML, JavaScript, JSON, and
mySQL to provide a user-friendly interface for Drexel computer science students to store class
schedules that ensure they are meeting the core CS requirements for their major. Students are
able to register with their name and a password in order to store past classes taken and possible
future schedules. After logging in to the application, students can search for particular CS classes
and also view classes by:

● Difficulty level (100, 200, 300, etc.)
● Computer science tracks
● Class code

When making potential schedules, the web application will check to make sure all prerequisites
are met for each class added, and will flag the class and show the prerequisites needed if
requirements are not met.
